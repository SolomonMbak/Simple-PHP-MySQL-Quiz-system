# Simple-PHP-MySQL-Quiz-system
It is a quiz system. I registers new users, displays the simple profile, and allows a user write a quiz and get scores at the end of the entire process. You can get the number of attempted questions, un-attempted questions and the questions you got wrong. The overall result is also shown in percentages.

PLEASE DO THESE FIRST
Be sure you have a program like XAMPP installed on your pc.
create a database, name it what ever you like (mine is quiz).
create a table and call it signup.

Thats it.
